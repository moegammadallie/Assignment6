## Patient tracking system for Occupational and Physio therapists
### By Moegammad Allie 209135816

The problem domain that I’ve decided to select is a “Patient tracking system for Occupational and Physio therapists”.  A family member, who is an Occupational therapist, has approached me with her current issue. She recently opened her own practice and struggling with keeping track of the multiple patient details, which gets updated on daily, weekly or monthly bases (Depending on the amount of appointments needed for each particular patient). 
She currently uses Excel spread sheets along with multiple journals/books to track a magnitude of different details about her patients. In one spread sheet she has details of the patient’s personal information (Names, age, parent’s details, accounts, address, first consultation date, etc.). In her Journal she tracks details about patient’s ailments (GP’s diagnoses, previous surgeries, and previous therapy details) and personal notes. She has another journal where she tracks the progress of her patient’s after each therapy session (Goal for each session, patient’s focus areas for next session etc.) which is then plotted onto another spread sheet, in order for her to plot an estimate of how much therapy the patient will require. She also tracks her equipment and tools on a separate journal (Availability, damaged, equipment that requires maintenance and replacements).
I feel that this could be could be built into a single system, that would cater for all the requirements that she needs to order to manage her practice. 

1. The Ideal path, would be to firstly prompt user to login using username and password. after successfully logging in the user (OT or PT)will have one system where they will be able to manage a diary and schedule. The user will also be able to keep track of tools on this system.
2. Patient info will be ready and available with regards to appointments, patient impediments, patient billing and progress.
